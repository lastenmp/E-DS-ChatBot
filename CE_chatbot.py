The tutor should ensure that the fundamental concepts related to operating systems and their installation, maintenance and remedies are understood and that the learning at this level should be substantially based upon applying such understanding in real or simulated settings. Emphasis should be on equipping learners to carry out the practical tasks associated with installing, using and maintaining an operating system. The practical focus should also offer opportunities for learners to benefit from presenting their ideas, discussing them with their peers and assessing what improvements can be made from this critical review.The activities recommended may include:Presenting foundational material on the installation, maintenance and use of operating systemsGiving direction to learners in terms of the practical aspects of operating system operationsActing as a sounding board at different stages of the learning processIndicating the tools that could usefully consideredEnabling learners to organise presentations and/or group discussionsFor best results it is recommended that the teaching and learning activities are informed by the following:Independent research carried out to develop knowledge and skills related to operating systemsStudies of real examples of operating system installation, maintenance and use in different, relevantcontexts in order to provide a variety of learning opportunities for learners that reflect the situations they may encounter in the future Scenarios and case studies based on real examples that are current and topical. These can be provided by either the learner or the tutor Suggested Assignments A list of suggested assignments methods are listed below in order for learners to practice and demonstrate to their lecturer that they are effectively learning the content. Unit criteria has been provided for your reference.Suggested AssignmentUnit CriteriaEssay: Professional practice and principles of operating systems Learners set out the principles of professional practice in relation to safety and the environment and the role, choices and features of operating systems. Within this they assess the relative merits of different Windows and Linux operating systems for use in different contexts.Report: Operating system interfacesLearners explain the operation of graphical and text-based interfaces in Windows. They identify the location of configuration panels and administrationtools and provide a description of the main features of these facilities.Mini case study: Installing Windows operating systemLearners carry out the installation of a specified Windows operating system.This includes assessing and ensuring hardware requirements are met and thatthe operating system is appropriately configured to ensure that the systemoperates efficiently and effectively. Mini case study: Troubleshooting a Windows operating systemLearners identify appropriate tools for use in troubleshooting a Windows operating system installation, apply these to identify systems faults and then apply appropriate remedial action, or, where this is not possible within the existing infrastructure and resources, specify what is required to secure adequate levels of performance. Mini case study: Installing applications in the Windows operating systemLearners install common applications in a Windows environment, havingassessed the installation requirements and verified that they are in place within the systems, taking account of safety and environmental procedures. They should check that these applications are operating effectively.Project: Practical operating system projectLearners undertake a comprehensive installation project for a personal computer. They critically assess the Windows operating system they are required to install, including in relation to Linux alternatives, and document for the user how graphical and text interfaces, configuration panels and administration tools can be used to extend and maintain the system. They install the operating system on a personal computer, ensuring that it is appropriately configured for the available hardware and that the hardware can support the OS and any intended applications. They then install the applications and test both the operating system and applications, identifying faults and taking remedial action where appropriate."]
